    <h2>The Misfits Rules</h2>
    <hr>
      <p>In light of recent events, we've created rules for the Misfits server.<br>
      You can find all of the rules below. We expect you to read these.</p>
    <hr>

    
    <li>No Witch-hunting</li>
    <li>When told to stop (via a Mod or other), stop.</li>
    <li>No targeted harassment</li>
    <li>No harassment of users (ex. sexuality, looks, etc etc)</li>
    <li>If for comedic purposes (jokes the other party would laugh at), you may joke about someone.</li>
    <li>If you see any breaking of the rules, use the <strong>-report</strong> command.</li>
  <hr>
    <h2>How to report someone appropriately</h2>
      <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>In the bot-commands channel, type -report (correct syntax - -report [user] [reason]) and report the user with the following format;<br>
          What was this user doing?<br>
          When was this user doing this?<br>
          If in DMs, can you provide a screenshot?</p>
            If we have probable cause to investigate, we will DM you. This is logged to a moderator to handle.

      <h3>Staff - How to moderate</h3>
        <p>In the <strong>-mod</strong> command, it displays all commands you can use for punishment. You can also find these at <a href="https://docs.carl.gg/moderation/moderation/" target="_blank">Carl-Bot's Moderation Documents.</a><br>
        Should you have any questions, please shoot Awex a DM/ping.</p>
