	<h2>LuckPerms Admin Directions</h2>
<p>In order to have tags for guilds, the server uses <strong>LuckPerms</strong>, a permissions manager.<br>
Admins have access to the Web editor to create guild groups for people who ask to create a new guild. This doc will go over how to do that.</p>
		<hr>

	<h2>How to get a web editor link</h2>
		<p>All admins have command permissions in order to access the web editor. All you will need to do is run <strong>/lp editor</strong> in Minecraft, click the link, and you'll be at the editor.</p>

	<h2>How to add and color a group</h2>
		<p>Upon creating a group, you will be greeted with the following screen.<br>
			In the <strong>Group Name</strong> section, put the name of the guild (ex buildersguild, medalpog). In Display Name, feel free to put the same thing.<br>
			In <strong>Prefix</strong>, put the following; [(MC Color Code)Name of Faction&f]<br>
		Leave Prefix blank (for now, we can probably add them later)</p>

	<h2>Adding a group to a user</h2>
		<p>As long as said user(s) have logged into the server and are active on it, you should see them pop up in the <strong>Players</strong> category.<br>
		You can remove the Default (Players) group by clicking the X, then pressing the + and then the group you made.<br>
		<p><strong>This can be accomplished via command by running /lp user (username) parent set (group name)</strong></p>

	<h2>Saving changes</h2>
		<p>When you're done in the editor, click the green <strong>Save</strong> button in the top right of the window. It will give you a command to paste in MC, once you paste it, you should be finished!</p>
