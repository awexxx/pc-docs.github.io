<h1>TheBoysBot (The Misfits Private Discord Server)</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>This bot was developed as a revamp to a private server.</p>
 <hr>
 <h2>How this bot was built</h2>
  <p>This bot was built with the <a href="https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot" target="_blank">Red Discord Bot</a> API. It currently is a node studio that, with "cogs" from git repositories, you can add different functions to your bot.<br>
Red Discord Bot is an easy way to make a bot, especially for free!</p>

<hr>
  
  <h2>How this bot is hosted 24/7</h2>
    <p>TheBoysBot is hosted on our local server. It auto-deploys when we update using a webhook and without worry of issues.</p>
